### 🎨 Design Inspiration & Original Work

The visual style of this website is **inspired by**:

👉 **https://brittanychiang.com**

That said:

- ❌ No source code was copied
- ✅ Built completely from scratch
- ✅ Different technology stack
- ✅ Custom components, animations, and APIs

Although the UI may feel familiar, the **codebase, architecture, logic, and features are entirely original**.

For implementation details, please refer to:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Framer Motion Documentation](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### 🧠 Easter Egg

The **“This website can’t be reached”** screen is an **original UX idea**, added as a playful experiment.  
Most users realize the joke within **~2 seconds**, after which the real content loads.

It’s intentionally quirky and meant to add personality to the site.
